## Executive Summary:

- This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Human Resources dataset.
- By analyzing employee data, we can identify trends and patterns that influence employee satisfaction and retention.
- The insights gained from this analysis can help HR departments make informed decisions to improve workplace satisfaction and reduce turnover.

### Problem

- Human resource management is critical for the overall success of an organization.
- Key challenges include understanding factors that affect employee satisfaction and retention.
- Accurate analysis is essential for developing strategies to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover rates.

### Objectives

1. **Analyze Employee Data**: Understand trends and patterns in employee demographics and satisfaction.
2. **Assess Impact of Factors**: Evaluate how different factors influence employee retention and satisfaction.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Develop and transform features to improve analysis accuracy.
4. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Recommend strategies for HR management based on analysis findings.

### About the Dataset:
