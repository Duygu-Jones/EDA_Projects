# Kyphosis Disease Analysis - EDA Projectüî¨üî•

---

## Executive Summary:

In this project, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the **Kyphosis.csv** dataset using Python.<br> 
The analysis will involve data cleaning, processing, visualization, and interpretation of key findings to derive actionable insights.

- **Objective:**
  - To understand the distribution of kyphosis conditions across different vertebra groups.
  - To visualize the range of kyphosis and recovery rates in the dataset.
  - To identify potential patterns or insights to inform further research or medical practices.

- **Methodology:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and analysis to gain insights into the dataset and provide recommendations for further research and potential applications in kyphosis diagnosis.<br>


### About the Kyphosis Dataset: 

- **Structural Analysis**  
    - **Dataset**: kyphosis.csv
    - **Number of Rows**: 81
    - **Number of Columns**: 4   

   
INPUTS:  
  1. **Age**: The age of the patient in months (children), 
  2. **Number**: The number of vertebrae involved in the surgery, 
  3. **Start**: The number of the first (top-most) vertebra operated on.
  4. **Kyphosis**: Indicates whether kyphosis was **present** or **absent** after the operation. 
   
OUTPUTS: Represents a factor with variables **present** and **absent** indicating if **kyphosis** (a type of deformation) was present or not after the corrective spinal surgery.


#### Understanding the Anatomy of Vertebrae

##### Groups of Anatomic Vertebrae: 

1. **Cervical Spine (C1-C7)** (Neck)
    - Number of Vertebrae: 7
2. **Thoracic Spine (T1-T12)** (Back)
    - Number of Vertebrae: 12
3. **Lumbar Spine (L1-L5)** (Lower back)
    - Number of Vertebrae: 5
4. **Sacrum (S1-S5, fused)** 
    - Number of Vertebrae: 5
5. **Coccyx (Co1-Co4, fused)**
    - Number of Vertebrae: 4

These groups represent the different sections of the vertebral column, with each section containing a specific number of vertebrae.

#### Feature Engineering: Classifying the 'Start' column in the Dataset to Anatomic Vertebrea Groups

In this Dataset; the **Start** column is the **first** (top-most) vertebra number operated on and contains the numbers between (1-18).

- We categorized the vertebra numbers in the Start column into Anatomical groups, and
- A new column 'Vertebrae Group'  is created to classify the values in the Start column.

    **Vertebrea Groups for the 'Start' column**
    - 1-7: Cervical (C1-C7) (Neck)
    - 8-19: Thoracic (T1-T12) (Back)
    - 20-24: Lumbar (L1-L5) (Lower Back)
    - 25-29: Sacrum (S1-S5) (Sacral)

- We labelled each group of vertebras with a number and created a new column called 'Vertebrae Group Number'.

    **Labels of the Vertebrea Groups**
    - (1) Cervical (C1-C7)
    - (2) Thoracic (T1-T12)
    - (3) Lumbar (L1-L5)
    - (4) Sacrum (S1-S5)
    - (5) Unknown

### Methodology:

1. Data Extraction and Cleaning:
   - Extracted and cleaned the data from the Kyphosis dataset using Pandas.
   - Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Transformed and standardized the data to prepare it for analysis.
   - Created new features and engineered existing ones to enhance the analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Performed statistical analysis and visualized the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Examined the relationships between different features and their impact on kyphosis classification.

### Skills:

- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, data cleaning, data visualization, statistical analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), handling missing values, descriptive statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating plots and charts to visualize data insights.


### Conclusion:

Creating detailed visualizations and performing statistical analysis provided insights into the characteristics of kyphosis patients.<br>
The visualizations highlighted key differences between patients with and without kyphosis, which could inform future predictive modelling efforts. 


#### Key Takeaways:

  1. **Treatment and Prevention Strategies:**
     - The balanced distribution of kyphosis in the cervical region suggests a need for careful planning of treatment and prevention strategies in this area.
     - The rarity of kyphosis in the thoracic region indicates a different approach may be required for patients in this area.
  
  2. **Attention to Start Vertebra Numbers:**
     - Higher kyphosis presence in specific vertebrae suggests developing special treatment protocols targeting these vertebrae.
  
  3. **Correlation Findings:**
     - The correlation between the number of vertebrae operated on and the start vertebra number can inform surgical planning. Operations starting from certain vertebrae tend to involve more vertebrae.


#### Next Steps:

Further analysis with advanced statistical tests and machine learning models is recommended to better understand and predict kyphosis.
