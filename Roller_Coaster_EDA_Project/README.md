## Executive Summary:

- This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Roller Coaster dataset.
- By analyzing various attributes of roller coasters, we can identify trends and patterns that influence their popularity and safety.
- The insights gained from this analysis can help amusement park operators make informed decisions about roller coaster design and maintenance.

### Problem

- The amusement park industry is highly competitive, and understanding the factors that contribute to a roller coaster's popularity and safety is crucial.
- Key challenges include analyzing various attributes like height, speed, and ride duration.
- Accurate analysis is essential for designing thrilling yet safe roller coasters and for improving existing rides.

### Objectives

1. **Analyze Roller Coaster Attributes**: Understand trends and patterns in roller coaster height, speed, duration, and other attributes.
2. **Assess Popularity Factors**: Evaluate how different factors influence a roller coaster's popularity.
3. **Safety Analysis**: Analyze safety records and identify potential risk factors.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Develop and transform features to improve analysis accuracy.
5. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Recommend strategies for roller coaster design and maintenance based on analysis findings.

### About the Dataset:

- **Dataset**: `roller_coaster_data.csv`
- **Content**: Information on various roller coasters, including attributes like height, speed, and duration.
- **Columns**:
    - **Name**: Name of the roller coaster.
    - **Park**: Amusement park where the roller coaster is located.
    - **Height**: Height of the roller coaster.
    - **Speed**: Speed of the roller coaster.
    - **Duration**: Duration of the ride.
    - **Inversions**: Number of inversions.
    - **Year Opened**: Year the roller coaster opened.
    - **Material Type**: Material of the roller coaster (e.g., steel, wood).
    - **Type**: Type of roller coaster (e.g., sit-down, inverted).

### Methodology

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data trends and patterns using various libraries.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve insights.
- **Analysis**: Assessing factors influencing roller coaster popularity and safety using various statistical and visualization techniques.

### Results and Key Takeaways

- **Trends and Patterns**: Identified key trends and patterns in roller coaster attributes.
- **Popularity Factors**: Analyzed factors that significantly influence roller coaster popularity.
- **Safety Insights**: Provided insights into potential safety risks and recommendations for improvements.

### Conclusion and Future Work

- This analysis offered valuable insights into factors affecting roller coaster popularity and safety.
- The findings can assist in designing more thrilling and safer roller coasters.
- Future work includes integrating more data for a comprehensive analysis and developing predictive models to further enhance roller coaster design and maintenance strategies.

### Recommendations
