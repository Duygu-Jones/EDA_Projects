## Executive Summary:

- This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Yemeksepeti pizza sales data to extract actionable business insights.
- By analysing sales patterns, customer behaviour, and promotional strategies, we identify key opportunities for revenue optimisation.
- The insights gained from this analysis help restaurants make data-driven decisions for pricing, marketing, and operational improvements.

### Problem

- Pizza restaurants face challenges in understanding customer preferences and optimising promotional strategies.
- Key challenges include analysing sales patterns across different time periods, evaluating promotional effectiveness, and identifying profitable product combinations.
- Accurate analysis is essential for maximising revenue and improving customer satisfaction.

### Objectives

1. **Analyse Sales Patterns**: Understand trends across hourly, daily, and monthly periods.
2. **Evaluate Product Performance**: Identify best-selling pizza varieties and their profitability.
3. **Assess Promotional Strategies**: Compare effectiveness of vouchers vs discounts using ROI analysis.
4. **Provide Business Insights**: Recommend data-driven strategies for revenue optimisation.
